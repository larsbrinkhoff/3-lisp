# 3-lisp: an infinite tower of meta-circular interpreters.

3-lisp is a dialect of Lisp designed and implemented by [Brian C. Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cantwell_Smith)
as part of his PhD. thesis [Procedural Reflection in Programming Languages](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/15961), 
also available in this repository. What this thesis refers to as "[reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_programming)" 
is nowadays more usually called "[reification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(computer_science))".

A [meta-circular evaluator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-circular_evaluator) is an interpreter for a programming language 
written in the language itself.
